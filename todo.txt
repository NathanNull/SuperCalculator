Make an unsized, owned matrix type (ideally using a single Vec) and rename the existing one to RefMatrix or something. Make repl parse that type
-> optional: change a bunch of datatypes to be dynamic size, with const-sized wrapper types in place of their originals (Vector is potentially a good example of this)
Functions (prob not user-defined ones tho)
Operator precedence
Go through and make a list of all the types and operations I want to include in the repl, and make a proper grammar for the thing
Add some documentation, otherwise nobody is going to understand this thing
